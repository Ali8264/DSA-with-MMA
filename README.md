# DSA-with-MMA
DSA Practice
# 🚀 DSA & LeetCode Practice Repository

This repository contains my **Data Structures & Algorithms practice**, focused on
**deep understanding, patterns, and interview preparation**.

## 📌 Goals
- Master core DSA patterns
- Build strong problem-solving intuition
- Prepare for SDE-1 / Backend interviews
- Practice clean, optimized code

## 🧠 Approach I Follow
For every problem:
1. Understand the problem in plain English
2. Write brute force solution
3. Identify the underlying DSA pattern
4. Implement optimized solution
5. Analyze time & space complexity
6. Handle edge cases

## 📂 Folder Structure
Each folder represents a **DSA pattern**:
- Arrays
- Hashing
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Stack
- Linked List
- Trees
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming

Each folder contains:
- Problem solutions
- `notes.md` for key learnings & patterns

## 🛠 Language Used
- C++ (Primary)

## 📈 Progress
This repository follows a **30-day structured DSA plan using LeetCode**.

## 🔗 Platform
- LeetCode
